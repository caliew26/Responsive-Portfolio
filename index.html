            <p>Howdy Y'all, my name is Cali and I'm a leo, I like long walks on the beach and drinking <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/" target="blank">Coco-Cola&#8482;</a> (just had to put that, this started off sounding like a dating portfolio, hahahaha). Seriously though, I'm Cali and I was born in Washington State (<a href="https://www.seahawks.com/" target="blank">go Hawks!</a>) many many many moons ago.  I have amazing parents and a few okay siblings.  I love to smile and laugh, if thats something someone says about me when I'm not there, I'm very happy with that.  I want to spread joy and happyness to everyone I meet and everywhere I go.  </p>
            
            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>I met my late husband John 19 years ago on the internet in a chatroom on AOL (Yup, back when that was cool) and in May would be celebrating our 13th anniversary. We had 2 "kids", Trip and Bear.  Trip will be 15 years old in May and is a jack russell; he loves long naps on his brothers bed and playing tug-o-war with his toy snake.  Bear would have been 13 this year, he was a lab/dingo mix; he was a lover, anyone who wanted to pet him was his best friend. We all lived in Kentucky for the past 12 years (I recon I've picked up the "Howdy" and "y'all" from everyone there).  Trip and I only recently moved to Florida, I just love the sun!  I wanted to be in a "happy place" as I work through some of lifes challenges.  I absolutely LOVE <a href="https://www.disney.com" target="blank">Disney&#8482;</a> and that "family" is such a strong theme with them, it's how I feel too. Have ya ever just went to one of the parks and just sat and watched; so many things to see and enjoy without even moving.  Only recently have I been told to bring my lunch and go to Tom Sawyer Park in Magic Kindgom and enjoy a picnic. What a wonderful idea!
            
                <h4>Faith</h4>
            <p>Christ has a HUGE part in my life. I know that because I put my trust in Him I will enjoy eternal life in heaven; and I'll get to see my hubby again! Looking for an awesome church, come visit <a href="http://www.theactionchurch.com/" target="blank">Action Church</a>.</p>
